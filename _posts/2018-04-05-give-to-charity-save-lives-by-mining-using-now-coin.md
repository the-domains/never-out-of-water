  or even uses NOW Coin will be helping save lives around the world. Every
  transaction will donate 0.1% of that transaction to the NOW Coin Wallet,
  here’s an example: I’ve mined 1,000 NOW Coins and I request a manual payout
  from my pool. As a result of this transaction 1 coin will be donated to the
  NOW Coin Wallet and the remaining 999 is sent to my wallet.

## **Save Lives by Mining + Using NOW Coin**

We've built a unique function into the coin network so that everyone who mines or even uses NOW Coin will be helping save lives around the world. Every transaction will donate 0.1% of that transaction to the NOW Coin Wallet, here's an example: I've mined 1,000 NOW Coins and I request a manual payout from my pool. As a result of this transaction 1 coin will be donated to the NOW Coin Wallet and the remaining 999 is sent to my wallet.

## **The NOW Coin Wallet**

All donations will go to the NOW Wallet and from there will go towards helping people gain access to clean water around the world. To prevent flooding our own market with donated coins we will set a recurring schedule to exchange to BTC and work with companies so they start accepting NOW Coin and become longtime holders. This will help to prevent large sums building up over extended periods of time and exchanging all at once. We will also offer the community the ability to purchase NOW Coin from the NOW Wallet. Pricing will be established from a market average and the amount of coins available will depend on total donations to the NOW Coin Wallet. More details regarding this feature are soon to come!
