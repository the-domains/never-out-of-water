## **Give to Charity + Save Lives** by Mining + Using NOW Coin

We've built a unique function into the coin network so that 
everyone who mines or even uses NOW Coin will be helping save 
lives around the world. Every transaction will donate 0.1% of that 
transaction to the NOW Coin Wallet, here's an example: I've mined 1,000 
NOW Coins and I request a manual payout from my pool. As a 
result of this transaction 1 coin will be donated to the NOW Coin Wallet 
and the remaining 999 is sent to my wallet.

## The NOW Coin Wallet

All donations will go to the Charity Wallet and from there will 
go towards helping people gain access to clean water around the world. To prevent flooding our own market with donated 
coins we will set a recurring schedule to exchange to BTC, this will 
help to prevent large sums building up over extended periods of time and
exchanging all at once. We will also offer the community the ability to
purchase NOW Coin from the Charity Wallet. Pricing will be 
established from a market average and the amount of coins available will
depend on total donations to the NOW Coin Wallet. More details regarding
this feature are soon to come!
