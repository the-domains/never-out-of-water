ABOUT US

Water is the single most important necessity of life. For some of us,
access to clean drinking water is as easy as turning on your faucet. 
But for nearly **800 MILLION people**, clean water just isn't available. In most cases, men, women, and children have one single 
source of water that is so polluted and contaminated it has become a 
poison. As a result, more than 4,000 people die EVERY DAY! 9/10 of 
deaths that are a result of unsafe and contaminated water are children 
under the age of 5\. It's difficult to fully comprehend that kind of 
devastation. But focusing on stats and merely discussing the issues 
won't help, it's time to actively participate.

The NOW Coin Initiative is designed and
developed to be a nonprofit organization. What does that mean? We are a
registered [Nonprofit Organization][0]
and we've created a Crypto Charity and coin that lets a community 
actively participate in helping provide clean water. To do that we've 
teamed up with [CharityWater.org][1]
so that we can create campaigns and raise funds for clean water 
projects. Also, the community can easily track exactly how we are doing 
by visiting our campaign page.
